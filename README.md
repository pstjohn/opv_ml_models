# Scripts and optimized model weights for predicting material optoelectronic properties

These files are intended to accompany an upcoming manuscript on accurately predicting optoelectronic properties of large molecules without 3D coordinates. Models use the nfp library (link) to provide the additional needed Keras layers.
